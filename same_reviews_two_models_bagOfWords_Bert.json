        "Tech2Comment1": "It is super easy to deposit money, however almost impossible to withdraw it. The last thing is that it won't let me in. If I use the option to recover the password (even if I don't forget it) they send me an e-mail with a link to change it. What the link does is take you to the same screen to enter the account, the same one that asks for the password, the same one that didn't work, nor now, with the same little button to recover the password... ..a serated circuit. The app is useless.",
        "Tech2Comment2": "I had 3 weeks that I could not log in after an update of the app, I could only enter from the web, after uninstalling the app 3 times and trying to enter without success, because it only told me the wrong password error, even so I decided to change the password and I can finally enter without problems, I never received any help from the binance support staff and it seems to me that it is a lack of attention to the public. The error should say password expired and not wrong password. Fix that."

I am new to cryptocurrencies and after several wallets I decided to try this one because of the multicoins it supports and I transferred 19 euros to test it... well, I made a transfer of 9 euros to another wallet and they charged me 3 as a commission... and for transferring 7 euros They charged me 6.5 euros to a trading website... and only 0.50 euros arrived at that website... laughable. Not to mention the exchange rates... I think that for exchanging 15 euros in bitcoin to dash they charged me 6 euros... impossible to operate like that. Be very careful with putting large amounts. If you see this wallet necessary, try first with what is fair. Greetings",
        "Tech2Comment2": "One of the worst wallet if not the worst! How can you explain those high fees? Like I have 100 euros in compound that I want to transfert and I have to pay 383 euros in eth ? How is this even possible? Coinbase wallet just gonna either rob you or make impossible for you to transfert your coins! DO NOT DOWNLOAD This APP"

Creating an account fails - it keeps sending an email link which is supposed to log into the app, except all it does is start the app and bring up the login screen. That sends another login email and round and round we go. I won't trust my money to a company that can't even manage to get their app to login.",

And my other friend can't accept the terms of BitPanda, so he can't activate his account. I need some help with this, please try and fix these problems! Otherwise the app is :thumbs_up:"

Cons: The app is pretty buggy, the load time is long compared to other crypto apps. There are no trading options such as buy on limit on the app (supposedly the online platform has it but the platform is not available in the USA). The responses from customer support tend to be useless. It would be nice to see more transparency on the fees.",
        "Tech1Comment2": "Great application so far, but it's not showing my pro subscription anywhere but here. We'll see if they can resolve the issue or I will be lowering the review. We'll find out if support is good because my pro isn't working and I paid for it. Will adjust accordingly. - RESOLVED EDIT: Excellent Customer service. They resolved the issue professionally and very fast. This is a solid company who stands behind their product. This is a fabulous app that tracks almost every Altcoin available. I use to all the time and run the extension in the Brave browser. There are no ads that I saw even in the non-professional version, but the pro version lets you do so much more. This is one of the best apps I have ever used off the Play Store and they are keeping the information and app up to date constantly.Weather you are new to Crypto currency or have been trading it a long time I highly recommend you try this app because it will only help you improve you profits. Awesome application and incredible support staff. Thanks!!",

Nothing has fixed it. And it isn't an issue with with the connection as I am able to do literally everything else in the app. This is obviously something server side.",

Reinstalled the app but nothing. Contacted support, nothing really too bad. Edit: it seems that it was the Webview app that caused the problem. Google fixed it and now it works. But all the same!

Refreshing will get stuck and show me a blank screen. This forces me to open another app or go to a pc. When it works I love the interface and being to create lists, making it much easier to find my assets without searching individually.",
        "Tech2Comment2": "It was working great until a day ago, I answered the quality questionnaire \"give us your opinion on the app\" and since then the app crashed when opened. Unusable. Reinstalled the app but nothing. Contacted support, nothing really too bad. Edit: it seems that it was the Webview app that caused the problem. Google fixed it and now it works. But all the same! And we had to go through the browser version which is FLOODED with ads. Pff why make it simple when you can make it complicated"

You have the graph on your web app, please just add that to the mobile app but please add 1day, 1 week view. You used to able to copy text from each transaction details page. Now that is not allowed, please add that back so it's easier for us to copy paste the trade amount to other portfolio tracker app. Since your app is terrible at portfolio tracking.",

        "Tech2Comment2": "No problems so far. Easy to use. Nice and simple. Minor gripe would be when scrolling up and down I end up swiping left or right and it goes to the sell page. Would be nice to see how much my coins have gone up or down over 24hrs and so on. I would definitely recommend for people who are new to crypto."

They resolved the issue professionally and very fast. This is a solid company who stands behind their product. This is a fabulous app that tracks almost every Altcoin available.

I stop with Binance it's no longer possible. It's impossible to be responsive under these conditions, an exchange platform of this level is a shame. And when you miraculously receive the code, it's several hours later. It's really taking customers for big c###",

        "Tech2Comment2": "The app used to be really good, but it's been spinning for a while now. On the one hand, portfolios and watchlists are empty and only appear again after logging in again, on the other hand, the app cannot be started at all. Nothing happens after the loading screen and the app closes, only reinstalling helps, which I will definitely stop now, because I don't want to go through the same procedure every morning."

        "Tech2Comment2": "What is that snot please? I pay almost 100% in fees to transfer from Coinbase to my wallet, so I pay almost 100% in fees to make a transaction on Uniswap. The problem, however, is that it still doesn't work, even though I've transferred enough ETH to make this transaction. So bottom line: I have to pay 200% in fees and don't get a chance to buy the coins I want. Real snot here."

How do I get my remaining 22 Ethereum back on my Coinbase without paying such expensive fees to you, I would like to delete this app again.",
        "Tech2Comment2": "Hmmm... my first Review dissappeared. Well this one doesnt get better. Horrendous fees. I have no idea, how somebody want to use this wallet. I just wanted to get used to it and give it a try, but this is really really expensive. It makes no Sense, if you shift only small amounts of money. I do not want to badmouth this App, i use coinbase for trading and i am happy with it, but this wallet makes me shaking my head and i will not touch it anymore."
