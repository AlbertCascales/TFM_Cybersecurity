Since the \"3rd dose\" update, it's getting faster and faster to get it, which makes it easier, but the developers could add other viruses because it's starting to get tiring, that said, it's getting harder and harder not to take the covid, but this one becomes easier to fight which, in the end can change. In any case I recommend it to you, strongly that it comes out on pc or ps5."
